# Rusty Primality Tests

This was a project I made to try to learn rust, so it's not gonna be the best tester out there. I currently have 3 algorithms: Brute Force, Marin-Rabin, Ballie-PSW(really buggy and slow).


## Installation

Install my-project with git clone then use cargo to build it

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/EpicLiem/Rusty_Primality_Tests.git
  cd Rusty_Primality_Tests
  cargo b --release
  ./target/release/rusty_primality_tests 
```


## How It Works

I barely understand how it works so I'm in no postion to explain it. Here is an article by Stanford on the Marin-Rabin Primality Test: [Article.](https://crypto.stanford.edu/pbc/notes/numbertheory/order.html)
